This game is intended to use the ‘DK Bongos’ controller. 

I use a “Mayflash W012” “Gamecube adaptor for PC, Wii U and Switch”. 

Any non-Nintendo GameCube to USB adaptor should work.

The official Nintendo adaptor (WUP-028) requires Zadig & vJoy setup. vJoy will break the native Dolphin support for this adaptor (This is a trench, look up YouTube or Reddit maybe?).

Any controller with at least four buttons will work though. Some other good fits for controllers are:
Taiko Drum
Rock Band Drums
DDR mat

This game doesn’t have native keyboard support, if you don’t have access to any game controllers, vJoy is a good option for Windows.
